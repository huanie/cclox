# cclox

A C++ port of clox, the Lox language's bytecode VM (http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

See also [dlox](https://github.com/rkirsling/dlox) for my Dart port of the AST interpreter.

_Disclaimer: cclox covers the material of Chapters 14-23 of the book. Namely, it has variables and control flow (with the  same enhancements to them as dlox) but it does not have functions or classes._
